Tax Freedom Day?
The Tax Freedom Day is the first day of a year, at which you have completed your income taxes as a taxable person. To illustrate this day, the date is calculated by counting the days from New Year's Day. It reflects the tax burden of taxpayers - depending on where they live in Switzerland, how much money they earn, whether they are married or not and whether they have children. Until this tax freedom day, taxpayers have worked only to pay their taxes â€“ in theory, of course. The rest of your annual taxable income remains with you.

Where is the data from?
The Swiss Federal Tax Administration (FTA) calculates the tax freedom day. The total amount of income taxes (federal, cantonal, municipal and church taxes) is summed up and divided by 365, the number of calendar days. The FTA uses the statistics of taxation oft he year 2011. Not included are mandatory health insurance premiums and social security taxes.
